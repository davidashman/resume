      measurable revenue acceleration and operational efficiency.

      As SVP of Engineering at Interfolio (acquired by Elsevier), David tripled the engineering team while holding expenses flat, driving 125% revenue growth and 
      expanding the company’s AWS footprint globally. He accelerated deployment velocity by 400% through CI/CD automation, achieved ISO27001 and TX-RAMP certifications, 
      and positioned the company for a strategic acquisition.

      Previously, as CTO of Teaching Strategies, David reshaped a contractor-heavy team into a high-performing engineering culture, cutting operational costs by 30%, achieving 
      SOC2 Type II compliance, and implementing cloud and open-source platforms that scaled with demand. Earlier at Blackboard, he led the SaaS transformation of Blackboard Learn, 
      reducing deployment times by 80% and increasing release cadence from biannual to monthly.

      David’s expertise spans SaaS scaling, cloud economics, security & compliance, and AI adoption. As a forward-facing technology executive, he specializes in translating AI 
      strategy into business value, helping organizations navigate the complexities of enterprise AI implementation while maintaining operational excellence. He is a recognized 
      thought leader, featured in The DevOps Handbook and on stage at the CTO Summit and DevOps Enterprise Summit.
