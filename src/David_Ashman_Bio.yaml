    - |-
      David Ashman is a transformational technology executive with over 20 years of experience leading engineering organizations, scaling SaaS platforms, 
      and guiding companies through periods of rapid growth, digital transformation, and M&A. He has built and led global teams across North America, Europe, 
      and Asia, consistently aligning technology strategy with business outcomes to deliver measurable revenue growth, operational efficiency, and customer impact.

      Most recently, David served as Senior Vice President of Engineering at Interfolio (acquired by Elsevier), where he tripled the size of the engineering 
      organization while holding expense growth flat through global talent strategy. He drove 125% revenue growth, expanded the company's global AWS footprint 
      into Europe, Canada, and Australia, and achieved ISO27001 and TX-RAMP certifications, strengthening security and compliance for higher education clients 
      worldwide. David also increased deployment velocity by 400% with CI/CD automation and positioned Interfolio for a successful strategic acquisition.

      Previously, as Chief Technology Officer of Teaching Strategies, David transformed the technology organization from a contractor-heavy team into a high-performing, 
      in-house engineering culture. He reduced operational costs by 30%, achieved SOC2 Type II certification, and implemented cloud and open-source platforms that scaled with customer demand.
    - |-
      Earlier in his career, David served as Vice President & Chief Architect at Blackboard, where he led the transformation of Blackboard Learn into a SaaS platform. His work reduced customer 
      deployment times by 80% and increased feature release cadence from biannual to monthly. He also held senior architecture roles at Capital One, where he guided large-scale AWS adoption 
      and architecture for major consumer partnerships.
    - |- 
      David is recognized as a thought leader in engineering leadership and SaaS transformation. He has spoken at the CTO Summit and the DevOps Enterprise Summit, and his work has been featured 
      in The DevOps Handbook and by IT Revolution.
